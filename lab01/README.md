**CS 262 - Lab 1**

This lab is based on [this.](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html)

Answers to the lab questions:

- This project will simply display "Hello, Expo!" on whatever platform its sent to.

- App.js is the JavaScript code which actually contains and defines what data is to be sent to the requesting party.

- package.json contains metadata and manages dependecies of the project. Very useful.

- It looks like node_modules is a library for files downloaded from npm.

- .gitignore is very simple, it tells git which files to ignore.
