This project will simply display "Hello, Expo!" on whatever platform its sent to.

App.js is the JavaScript code which actually contains and defines what data is to be sent to the requesting party.

package.json contains metadata and manages dependecies of the project. Very useful.

It looks like node_modules is a library for files downloaded from npm.

.gitignore is very simple, it tells git which files to ignore.
