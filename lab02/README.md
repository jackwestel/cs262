**CS 262 - Lab 2**

Answers to the lab questions:

- I believe the name of the component in this is App.

- One prop would be 'rAge' in my FlatList and one state element would be 'name'.

- The curly braces both tell the JSX parser that it should be interpreted javascript, and then the inner curly braces denote when a variables value in html. They have two functions.

- The function onChangeText utilizes anonymous functions.

- No. React Native uses exclusively itself and JSX.
